## Idea 1: "Nordic Clarity"

**Design Movement:** Scandinavian Minimalism meets Corporate Modernism.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Radical Simplicity:** Every element must have a purpose. Remove all visual clutter.
2.  **Nature-Inspired Palette:** Colors drawn from the Estonian landscape (sea, forest, stone).
3.  **Structured Asymmetry:** Layouts that balance order with organic flow, avoiding rigid grids.
4.  **Human Warmth:** Despite the minimalism, the design should feel approachable and personal, reflecting the mother-daughter partnership.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Deep Blue (#0D47A1):** Represents the depth of the Baltic Sea and professional trust.
*   **Light Beige (#F5F5DC):** Evokes the warmth of sand and stone, grounding the design.
*   **Warm Grey (#BDBDBD):** A neutral bridge between the strong blue and soft beige.
*   **Accent Gold (#FFD700):** Used sparingly to highlight key actions, symbolizing value and growth.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Split-Screen Hero:** A vertical split layout for the hero section, juxtaposing a strong statement with an abstract visual.
*   **Whitespace as Structure:** Using generous margins and padding to define sections rather than lines or borders.
*   **Floating Cards:** Content modules that appear to float above the background, adding depth without heaviness.

**Signature Elements:**
*   **Geometric Overlays:** Subtle, semi-transparent geometric shapes (circles, triangles) layered over images to suggest structure and connection.
*   **Fine Line Iconography:** Custom icons drawn with a single, thin line weight to match the typography.
*   **Soft Shadows:** Very diffuse, large drop shadows to create a sense of elevation.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Gentle Parallax:** Subtle movement of background elements on scroll to create depth.
*   **Smooth Fade-ins:** Content elements fade in and slide up gently as they enter the viewport.
*   **Hover Lifts:** Interactive elements (buttons, cards) lift slightly and cast a deeper shadow on hover.

**Animation:**
*   **Slow & Deliberate:** Animations should be slow and smooth, reflecting a calm and considered approach to consulting.
*   **Staggered Reveals:** Text and images reveal in a staggered sequence to guide the eye.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** *Spectral* (Serif) - Elegant, legible, and authoritative. Used for all major headings.
*   **Body:** *Inter* (Sans-serif) - Clean, neutral, and highly readable for dense information.
*   **Hierarchy:** Large, high-contrast headings paired with smaller, lighter body text.

## Idea 2: "Digital Architect"

**Design Movement:** Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) meets Tech Brutalism.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Grid-Based Precision:** A visible or strongly implied grid system that organizes content with mathematical rigor.
2.  **Bold Typography:** Type is used as a primary graphic element, large and expressive.
3.  **High Contrast:** Strong contrast between background and foreground to ensure maximum legibility and impact.
4.  **Function Over Form:** The design prioritizes the delivery of information and the clarity of the message.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Deep Blue (#0D47A1):** Used as a dominant background color for key sections, creating a bold, immersive experience.
*   **Soft White (#F8F8F8):** High contrast text against the blue, and clean backgrounds for reading-heavy sections.
*   **Accent Gold (#FFD700):** Used for technical accents, lines, and data visualization elements.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Modular Grid:** A strict modular grid where content blocks snap into place.
*   **Horizontal Scrolling:** Sections that scroll horizontally to reveal timelines or process steps.
*   **Sticky Headers:** Section headers that stick to the side or top as you scroll through the content.

**Signature Elements:**
*   **Visible Grid Lines:** Subtle lines that reveal the underlying structure of the page.
*   **Monospace Accents:** Use of a monospace font for tags, dates, and technical details.
*   **Data Visualization:** Abstract charts and graphs integrated directly into the layout as decorative elements.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Snap Scrolling:** Sections snap into place to ensure the user sees the content exactly as intended.
*   **Hover Reveals:** Hovering over a grid item reveals more detailed information or a related image.
*   **Cursor Effects:** A custom cursor that changes state (e.g., expands, changes color) based on the element underneath.

**Animation:**
*   **Sharp Transitions:** Cuts and slides are quick and precise, reflecting efficiency.
*   **Typewriter Effect:** Key messages type out character by character.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** *Inter* (Bold/Black) - Used in large sizes for maximum impact.
*   **Body:** *Roboto* or *Inter* - Clean and functional.
*   **Accents:** *JetBrains Mono* or similar monospace for technical details.

## Idea 3: "Organic Flow"

**Design Movement:** Soft Modernism / Organic Tech.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Fluid Shapes:** Avoiding sharp corners in favor of rounded edges and organic curves.
2.  **Connectedness:** Visual elements that flow into one another, symbolizing the partnership and the holistic approach.
3.  **Soft Lighting:** The use of gradients and blurs to create a sense of light and atmosphere.
4.  **Empathy First:** The design should feel welcoming, supportive, and human-centric.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Light Beige (#F5F5DC):** The primary background color, creating a warm and inviting canvas.
*   **Deep Blue (#0D47A1):** Used for text and key graphical elements, providing contrast without harshness.
*   **Warm Grey (#BDBDBD):** Used for secondary text and subtle backgrounds.
*   **Gradient Blends:** Soft gradients blending the blue, beige, and gold to create ethereal backgrounds.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Curved Section Dividers:** Sections are separated by gentle curves rather than straight lines.
*   **Central Axis:** Content flows down a central axis, branching out organically.
*   **Overlapping Elements:** Images and text blocks overlap slightly to create a sense of depth and connection.

**Signature Elements:**
*   **Blob Shapes:** Organic, amorphous shapes used as background elements to hold images or text.
*   **Frosted Glass:** Glassmorphism effects for cards and overlays, adding a modern touch.
*   **Hand-Drawn Accents:** Subtle hand-drawn lines or circles to highlight key points, adding a human touch.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Liquid Motion:** Elements morph and change shape fluidly as the user interacts.
*   **Scroll-Linked Animations:** Elements move at different speeds (parallax) and change opacity based on scroll position.
*   **Soft Hovers:** Buttons and cards glow softly on hover.

**Animation:**
*   **Morphing Shapes:** Background shapes slowly morph and change color.
*   **Fade and Float:** Content floats in gently, as if suspended in liquid.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** *Spectral* (Italic/Regular mix) - Using italics for emphasis and a softer tone.
*   **Body:** *Open Sans* or *Lato* - Friendly and rounder sans-serifs.
